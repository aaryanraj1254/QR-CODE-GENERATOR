index.js

This is the main application file that sets up the Express.js server and defines routes for the application.

The first few lines require the necessary modules: express, ejs, path, and qrcode.
The Express.js app is created, and the port is set to either the environment variable PORT or 3000 if it's not set.


The app uses express.json() and express.urlencoded() middleware to parse JSON and URL-encoded requests.


The view engine is set to ejs, and the views directory is set to the views folder in the current directory.


The app defines two routes:
GET /: Renders the index.ejs template.
POST /scan: Handles the form submission from the index.ejs template, generates a QR code from the input text, and renders the scan.ejs template with the generated QR code.
index.ejs

This is the main entry point of the application, where users can input text to generate a QR code.

The HTML structure is defined, including a form with a text input and a submit button.
The form's action attribute is set to /scan, which will send a POST request to the /scan route when the form is submitted.
scan.ejs

This template is rendered when the /scan route is called, displaying the generated QR code.

The HTML structure is defined, including an img tag that will display the generated QR code.


The src attribute of the img tag is set to the qr_code variable, which is passed from the /scan route.


A "Back" button is provided to allow users to return to the main page.
QR Code Generation

When the /scan route is called, the following happens:

The input text is retrieved from the request body using req.body.text.
The qrcode module is used to generate a QR code from the input text using the toDataURL() method.


If an error occurs during QR code generation, a 500 error response is sent with an error message.


If the QR code is generated successfully, the scan.ejs template is rendered with the generated QR code as a data URL.


That's a summary of the code! Let me know if you have any specific questions or need further clarification.
